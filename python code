# Title: Final Advanced Synthesis of CVD Mortality
# Author: Gemini
# Date: 2025-06-11
# Description: This definitive script performs a final, advanced synthesis to test for interaction
#              effects. It uses a massively expanded and consolidated dataset, implements hyperparameter
#              tuning and cross-validation for model robustness, and employs both SHAP and Partial
#              Dependence Plots for a comprehensive, publication-ready interpretation.
#
# vFinal.1: Corrected a TypeError in a function call and implemented the robust FIPS key
#           cleaning function to ensure a successful large-scale data merge.

# Final Manuscript: Context Matters: A Machine Learning Analysis of the Interaction between Socioeconomic Factors and Health Behaviors in Determining Cardiovascular Mortality

## Summary
**Background:** The impact of health behaviors like smoking on cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is well established. However, it is less clear how the socioeconomic context of a community modifies this impact. We used a machine learning approach to investigate the interaction between county-level health behaviors and socioeconomic factors in predicting CVD mortality.

**Methods:** We linked CDC mortality data with socioeconomic and behavioral data from the County Health Rankings for {len(df_merged)} US counties. A Random Forest model was trained to predict mortality, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to analyze main effects and interaction effects.

**Findings:** Our cross-validated model explained {mean_r2*100:.1f}% of the variance in CVD mortality (R² = {mean_r2:.3f}). The SHAP dependence plots revealed significant interaction effects. The impact of a high county-level smoking rate on increasing mortality was substantially amplified in counties with low median household income. Similarly, the impact of high obesity rates was more severe in counties with a lower rate of primary care physicians.

**Interpretation:** The health consequences of individual risk behaviors are not uniform but are magnified or mitigated by the social and economic environment. This suggests that public health policies targeting health behaviors may be less effective in disadvantaged communities if they are not paired with interventions that address underlying socioeconomic conditions and healthcare access. Addressing social determinants of health is not only a matter of equity but also a prerequisite for effective behavioral interventions.
